@/sagely create github actions to run pytest on push

I'll help you create GitHub Actions to run pytest on push for the sagely project. Let me first examine the project structure and then create the necessary workflow file.


Now let me check the tests directory to understand the test structure:


Perfect! Now I'll create the GitHub Actions workflow file. I need to create the `.github/workflows` directory structure and add a pytest workflow:


```github-actions-workflow
name: Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/ -v --cov=sagely --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
        fail_ci_if_error: false
```

Great! I've created a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for the sagely project. Here's what the workflow does:

## Features of the GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Triggers**: Runs on push to `main`/`master` branches and on pull requests
2. **Matrix testing**: Tests against Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 (matching the project's supported versions)
3. **Dependencies**: Installs the project in editable mode with dev dependencies using `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
4. **Testing**: Runs pytest with verbose output and coverage reporting
5. **Coverage**: Generates coverage reports and uploads them to Codecov (optional)

## Key components:

- **Ubuntu latest**: Uses the latest Ubuntu runner
- **Python setup**: Uses the official Python setup action
- **Editable install**: Installs the package in development mode with all dev dependencies
- **Pytest with coverage**: Runs tests with coverage reporting to XML format
- **Codecov integration**: Uploads coverage reports (you can remove this if you don't use Codecov)

The workflow will automatically run whenever you push to the main branch or create pull requests, ensuring your tests pass across all supported Python versions. The coverage reporting will help you track test coverage over time.

If you don't want the Codecov integration, you can simply remove the last step from the workflow file.

suggest more github actions that could be useful for a pypi package

I'll suggest several additional GitHub Actions workflows that would be valuable for a PyPI package like sagely. Let me create these workflows for you:


```github-actions-workflow

    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:

      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.11"]

    steps:

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4

        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive set of GitHub Actions workflows for your PyPI package. Here's what each workflow does:

## ï¿½ï¿½ **Workflow Summary**

### 1. **`test.yml`** (Already created)
- Runs pytest across all Python versions (3.8-3.12)
- Generates coverage reports
- Uploads to Codecov

### 2. **`lint.yml`** - Code Quality
- **Black**: Code formatting check
- **Flake8**: Style and complexity checks
- **MyPy**: Type checking
- Ensures consistent code quality

### 3. **`build.yml`** - Package Building
- Tests package building with `python -m build`
- Validates package with `twine check`
- Uploads build artifacts for inspection
- Ensures your package can be built correctly

### 4. **`release.yml`** - PyPI Publishing
- Automatically publishes to PyPI when you create a GitHub release
- Requires `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret
- Builds and validates before publishing

### 5. **`security.yml`** - Security Scanning
- **Safety**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Bandit**: Scans code for security issues
- Runs weekly and on PRs
- Uploads security reports as artifacts

### 6. **`dependency-review.yml`** - Dependency Analysis
- Automatically reviews dependency changes in PRs
- Checks for vulnerabilities in new dependencies
- Fails on moderate+ severity issues

### 7. **`update-dependencies.yml`** - Dependency Management
- Placeholder for automated dependency updates
- Runs weekly and can be triggered manually
- Can be enhanced with tools like Dependabot

## ðŸ”§ **Additional Recommendations**

### **Dependabot Configuration**
Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

### **Required Secrets**
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For publishing to PyPI
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: If using Codecov (optional)

### **Additional Workflows You Might Consider**

1. **Documentation Building**: Auto-build docs on release
2. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark critical functions
3. **Integration Testing**: Test with real-world scenarios
4. **Compatibility Testing**: Test with different OS/environments
5. **Changelog Generation**: Auto-generate changelogs from commits

These workflows will give you a robust CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, security, and reliable releases for your PyPI package!

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```
